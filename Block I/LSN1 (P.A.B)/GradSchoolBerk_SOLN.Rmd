## Exploring the Berkeley Grad School Dataset

```{r grad, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(vcd)
library(table1)
# library(ggmosaic)

grad <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jkstarling/MA376/main/Berkeley.csv")

grad <- read_csv("Berkeley.csv")
```

### Explore the Berkeley Data set

Let's take a look at the data:

```{r glimpse}
head(grad)
glimpse(grad)
table(grad$Program)
table(grad$Program, grad$Sex)
table(grad$Accepted,grad$Sex)
```


**Observational units:** *People who are applied to grad school at UC Berkeley.*

**Variables**

+ **Response variable:** 
  + *Accepted (binary) (yes/no)*

+ **Explanatory variables:**
  + *Sex (categorical) (Male/Female)*
  + *Program (categorial) (A/F)*


Let's change the variables to be categorical:

```{r}
grad2 <- grad %>% mutate(Program = as.factor(Program)) %>% 
         mutate(Sex = as.factor(Sex)) %>% 
         mutate(Accepted = as.factor(Accepted))
```


### Create a bar plot of accepted vs rejected.

```{r}
acc2 <- grad2 %>% pull(Accepted) %>% 
  fct_count() %>% 
  mutate(perc = n / nrow(grad2))
# same as above: # acc2 <- fct_count(grad2$Accepted) %>% mutate(perc = n / nrow(grad2))
acc2 %>% ggplot(aes(x=f)) + 
  geom_bar(aes(y=perc),stat = "identity") + 
  labs(x="Accepted", y="% of students") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::percent)

```

What do we see here? 

*Most (60%) of the applicants were rejected.*

### Create a Contingency Table

We can ask the question, "Is the admissions process at Berkeley fair?". Or a more focused question, "Does the admissions process at Berkeley disproportionately affect women applicants?"

```{r echo=TRUE}
table1(~Accepted | Sex, data=grad2)

```

What do we see here? Is the 

### Create Mosaic plot


Create a mosaic plot to see the data related to sex and acceptance: 

```{r}
# labs <- round(prop.table(table(grad2$Accepted, grad2$Sex)),2)
mosaic(~Sex+Accepted, data=grad2, highlighting="Accepted", highlighting_fill = c("lightblue", "lightgreen"), direction=c("v","h"))
```

What does this plot tell us? Are sex and acceptance *associated*?

*It looks like there are less females accepted. Also, more males applied to grad school. Sex and acceptance are associated.*

Does the program a person applied to make a difference? To explore this, we will condition on the program applied to:
```{r}
mosaic(~Program+Accepted+Sex, data=grad2, highlighting="Accepted", highlighting_fill = c("lightblue", "lightgreen"), direction=c("v","h","v"))
```

What does this plot tell us? Is program associated with acceptance? How is this different than the previous plot?

*For program A, it appears that less females applied, but they were accepted at a higher rate than males. For program F, it appears that roughly an equal number of females and males applied and were accepted at roughly the same (lower) rate.*
*We also see that program AND sex are associated with acceptance.*

*This is called Simpson's paradox, where the direction of the association between sex and acceptance reverses direction.*


Here we look at the association between acceptance and program, conditioned on sex: 

```{r}
mosaic(~Sex+Accepted+Program, data=grad2, highlighting="Accepted", highlighting_fill = c("lightblue", "lightgreen"), direction=c("v","h","v"))
```

What do we notice here compared to our first mosaic plot above? 

*We notice that must consider the program and the sex when considering the acceptance rates for males and females.*

What can we say about our original question, "Does the admissions process at Berkeley disproportionately affect women applicants?"? What do we call the variable *program*? 

*When looking only at acceptance rates and sex, we may incorrectly say that females have a  disproportionate admission rate if we do not consider which program they applied to. 'Program' is called a confounding variable. (draw diagram if necessary)*
